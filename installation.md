# Pre‑Workshop Installation Guide: 10 Docker Commandos

## 0. Pre‑Workshop Preparation

### a) Install Docker Desktop (recommended)
- **Download and install** Docker Desktop for your OS.
- **To switch context after installation**, open your terminal and run:
  ```bash
  docker context ls
  docker context use desktop-linux
  ```
  Make sure to replace `desktop-linux` with the appropriate context for your OS.

### b) If using Docker-CE (Engine) without Desktop
- You'll need to install necessary **CLI plugins manually** for commands like `docker sbom`, `docker scout`, and others.

### Install the following command-line tools:

- `vexctl`
-

## Manual Plugin Installation for Docker CE (non‑Desktop)

### 1. **Docker Scout**
To install Docker Scout manually:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/scout-cli/main/install.sh -o install-scout.sh
sh install-scout.sh
```

### 2. **Docker SBOM**
To install the Docker SBOM plugin:
```bash
# install the docker-sbom plugin
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/sbom-cli-plugin/main/install.sh | sh -s --

# use the sbom plugin
docker sbom <my-image>
```

### 3. **Docker Model Runner**
Installing Model Runner manually on Linux requires compiling a standalone binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/docker/model-cli.git
cd model-cli
make build
./model install-runner
```

Then, you can run models like this:

```bash
model run ai/gemma3
```

### 4. **CAgent**
CAgent is not extensively discussed in the workshop, so installation is optional. If you want to try it out, you can download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/docker/cagent/releases).

## Summary & Tips for Attendees

- **Docker Desktop** is strongly recommended as it includes most features out of the box.
- For **Docker CE users**, manual installation of plugins is necessary for full functionality.
- Most of the commands won't work on alternative runtimes like **OrbStack**.
